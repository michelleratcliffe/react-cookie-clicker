# Cookie Mania

<h1>User Stories</h1>
<p>🐿️ As a developer, I want the application to use the <strong>useState hook</strong> so that the user’s interactions with the app are smooth and their data is managed effectively.</p>
<p>🐿️ As a developer, I want to use the <strong>useEffect hook to manage game time with setInterval</strong>, return a cleanup function, and use a dependency array so that the game runs efficiently and updates in real-time for the user.</p>
<p><🐿️ As a developer, <strong>I want to create separate files that return JSX</strong> instead of including all JSX within App.jsx so that the <strong>code is well-organized</strong>, making the app more maintainable and reliable for the user./p>
<p>🐿️ As a user, <strong>I want the application to automatically update the game state every second</strong> so that I can see my progress and earned cookies in real-time, making the game more exciting and rewarding.</p>
<p>🐿️ As a developer, <strong>I want to use the .map() function to render lists</strong> of items efficiently so that the user can see dynamic content without performance issues.</p>
<p>🐿️ As a user, <strong>I want to purchase upgrades with my earned cookies to increase my cookies per second</strong>, making the gameplay more rewarding.</p>

<h1>Stretch User Stories</h1>

NOTES

STRETCH GOALS
//localstorage preseve game data
//use same api or make your own or use an array in app.jsx (last one wont count for stretch goal) create api like mono reaper for creating an api - HAVE TO use render
//extra points for creating own array

//extra marks for visual styling = themes = settings = login loggoff = achievements = notifications = favicon = googlefonts
